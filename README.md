# Dotfiles

A personal collection of my configurations for different programs.

## Usage

These dotfiles are managed using `stow`.
So make sure that you have stow installed in your system.

```sh
$ brew install stow
```

After this, just stow all the packages:

```sh
$ stow */
```

And that's all! :shipit:
